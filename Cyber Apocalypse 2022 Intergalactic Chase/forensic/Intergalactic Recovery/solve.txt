The damaged disk was rebuilt using the tool (http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/xorfiles.html).

Then the images were mapped to devices:

sudo losetup /dev/loop1 disk1.img
sudo losetup /dev/loop2 disk2.img
sudo losetup /dev/loop3 disk3.img

The next step was to rebuild the RAID array:
sudo mdadm --create --assume-clean --level = 5 --raid-devices = 3 /dev/md0 /dev/loop2 /dev/loop3 /dev/loop1

and mounting the device:

mount /dev/md0 /mnt/raidarray

There was a PDF file (imw_1337.pdf) in the mounted device.
After opening it, we saw the flag:

HTB {f33ls_g00d_t0_b3_1nterg4l4ct1c_m0st_w4nt3d}
